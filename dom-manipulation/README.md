__Time Limit:__ 30 minutes  
__Skill Level:__ Beginner

##Instructions:
Create a simple webpage with the following elements:
- All div elements should be centered and have the same width
- A flat navigation bar with a dotted border on the bottom
- 4 sections
 - The first should have a centered heading that says 'Welcome to the Dom'
 - The second section should have a button that makes the background blue
 - The third section should have a button that makes the background red
 - The fourth section should have a button that makes the background white

##Refactor
 - What's the smallest amount of lines you can write your script in?
 - What if you only have one button on the page, can you get it to do the job of the previous three?
