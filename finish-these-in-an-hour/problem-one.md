## Problem 1
### Track One: Get It Done
Write three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in a given list using a for-loop, a while-loop, and recursion.

### Track Two: Write Tests
Write tests first! Implement a test driven solution for three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in a given list using a for-loop, a while-loop, and recursion.
